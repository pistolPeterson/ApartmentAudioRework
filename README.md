# Apartment Audio Implementation
This is a full audio implemention of a apartment scene. I'll be usisng Wwise to make interesting and immersive choices for the audio soundscape


## Phase 0: Unity (currently working on)
- [x] Integrate Wwise with the Unity project
- [x] Create script to represent TV on and off state
- [x] Create Main Menu Scene that transitions to the game
- [ ] Add trigger zones on specific areas that are also delay based
## Phase 1: Audio
- [ ] Passive SFX: Refrigerator hum, Footsteps, Clock,tv turned on/off (with user delay)
- [ ] Active SFX: police siren, neighbors arguing + hip hop music, rustling plant  
- [ ] SFX state change: clock gets louder/disorted + 2d audio, 

## Phase 2: Music
- [ ] Create Music with different layers, based on trigger zones in Phase 0
- [ ] Develop interactive music system  
- [ ] test system fully

## Phase 3: Dialogue (im not a voice actor :) )
- [ ] Create voice files 
- [ ] connect the voice files to play, when activated by the trigger zones in Phase 0 
- [ ] Sidechain dialogue vs the audio/music
- [ ] Test dialogue system fully

## Phase 4: Cleaning up and Optimizations
- [ ] Test all possible interactions in gamee
- [ ] add end credits scene to finish game
- [ ] Make Unity and Wwise project more organized 
- [ ] Optimize WWise to use as little memory and processing power as possible 
- [ ] Create Build of game! 



## Installation For Audio Programmers, Audio Designers, Music implementors 
For anyone who wants to have the project with full control. NOT reccomended at all if you have no experience with WWise or audio middleware software. 
Information coming soon. The assumption will be that you know how Wwise works and how to integrate it with Unity


## Installation for Unity Users 
Information coming soon. Im trying to see if I can make a seperate branch with only the unity project and the specific soundbanks so you dont have to use the WWise software

## For playtesters
Link will be here for a build of the game once I have a good demo in place 





## Demo Video
Link coming towards end of project
