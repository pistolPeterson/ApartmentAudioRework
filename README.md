# Apartment Audio Implementation
This is a full audio implemention of a apartment scene. I'll be usisng Wwise to make interesting and immersive choices for the audio soundscape

### Currently working on: getting assets, setting up wwise and unity to source control, making plans for creative decisions


## Installation For Audio Programmers, Audio Designers, Music implementors 
Information coming soon. The assumption will be that you know how Wwise works and how to integrate it with Unity


## Installation for Unity Users 
Information coming soon. Im trying to see if I can make a seperate branch with only the unity project and the specific soundbanks so you dont have to use the WWise software

## For playtesters
Link will be here for a build of the game once I have a good demo in place 

# Visuals
Coming soon 

## Demo Video
Link coming soon
